# Multiaxis Blend Calculator

Generates a discrete set of proportions to mix together 3-4 ingredients, in order to evenly cover the range of possible combinations. For 4 ingredients, there are various ways of defining what exactly that means.

There's nothing here that can't in principle be done by hand, it's just a bunch of linear interpolation and keeping track of combinations. But that's tedious, and my spreadsheet for this was starting to get annoying to work with, so I made a React app instead.
